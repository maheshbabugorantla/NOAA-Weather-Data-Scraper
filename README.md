# NOAA-Weather-Data-Scraper

Here NOAA Stands for "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"

This is Weather Data Scraper that is used to scrape the Weather Data from NOAA Website

I have designed this to automate the scraping of weather data in different regions from the nearest Weather Stations available as listed on the NOAA Website

The Motivation behind the design of this Web-Scraper is to facilitate the understanding of the weather data by doing historical analysis for a specific region e.g. NAPA VALLEY, CA and to do predictive analytics on available data to help farmers understand the weather models.

To further understand more about the program please look at the comments mentioned in the code. They are pretty much self explanatory.

This Weather Data Scraper is made in C#.
